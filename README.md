# Masculinity-OS 2.0 — System Update Available (Beta)

> A systems-inspired thought experiment reprogramming modern masculinity.

---

## 🧠 What is Masculinity-OS?

Masculinity-OS is an operating system designed to examine and rebuild the way we think about masculinity in the 21st century.

Using systems thinking, modular architecture, and code, this project explores the scripts men inherit, the behaviors they run, and the environments they’re forced to adapt to.

## 📂 File Structure

Each Python file represents a core subsystem of the Masculinity Operating System:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `core.py` | Defines the base identity architecture of masculinity. |
| `drivers.py` | Interfaces between biological drives and cultural scripts. |
| `ui.py` | The “User Interface” — how masculinity is performed and perceived. |
| `legacy.py` | Handles deprecated models: alpha/beta, stoicism, toxic archetypes. |
| `updates.py` | Checks for internal evolution and system-wide upgrades. |
| `utils.py` | Contains helpers like self-reflection, value-checks, and clarity tools. |

## ⚙️ Systems Philosophy

Masculinity-OS treats manhood as a **modular, updatable framework**, not a monolithic identity.

- 🧩 **Modular**: Different contexts require different traits.
- 🔄 **Updateable**: You’re allowed to evolve.
- 🛠️ **Debuggable**: You can reflect, reprogram, and rebuild.
- 🧠 **Integrated**: Healthy masculinity isn’t about becoming what others want — it’s about aligning with who you are.
